* Open a command-line shell to the `qblint-gas` directory .
* Install dependencies with `npm install`.
* Run `npm run build` to compile `src/` and rollup imports to `Code.bs.js` in root folder.
* `npm run dev` compiles without rollup and `npm run deploy` pushes to Google Scripts (if you've set up clasp and a scripts project).
